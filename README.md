# SpriteKit-game
ProjectCat is an iOS augmented reality (AR) app developed using Apple's SwiftUI, RealityKit and ARKit frameworks. The app features a 2D cat that walks on the horizontal plane, showcasing movement behavior, animation, and texture switching. This project serves as a learning exercise to understand the basics of RealityKit, ARKit, SwiftUI and practice with Swift programming language.

## Project Description

This project implements several features to create a  AR experience:<br/>
<br/>
- Creating a Mesh: Constructed a simple mesh to represent the 2D cat in the AR environment.<br/>
- Adding a Texture: Applied a texture image of a cat to the mesh to provide a visual representation.<br/>
- Update Function: Developed an update function with a switch statement to handle the cat's states, which include:<br/>
  - Walking: The cat moves in a random direction.<br/>
  - Idle: The cat remains stationary.<br/>
- Random Timer: Implemented a variable that generates a random number used to set a timer, determining the duration of each state.<br/>
- Idle Function: Changes the cat's texture to an idle image when the cat is not moving.<br/>
- Walking Function: Changes the cat's texture to a walking image and assigns a random direction for movement.<br/>
- Audio: audio plays when cat is in the idle state

  ## Learning Outcomes

- Master the basics of RealityKit for AR development.<br/> 
- Develop skills in Swift and SwiftUI.<br/> 
- Implement interactive and animated AR experiences.<br/> 
- Understand texture management and state-based animations in RealityKit.<br/>
